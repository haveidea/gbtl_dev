Graphblas API Implementation
============================

------------
This package provides an implementation of the current GraphBLAS API in C++,
as well as implementations of common graph algorithms built on top of this
GraphBLAS implementation.  Two backends are provided: a GPU backend built on
cusp/thrust libraries (called cusp_gpu), and a simple CPU backend (called
sequential).

Building
--------

Currently, there are two different GraphBLAS backends implemented: A CPU
backend, which is named sequential, and a GPU backend, which is implemented on
top of CUSP, called cusp_gpu.

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If it is desired to build using the cusp backend, CUSP must also be added
to this project.  To do so, download cusp from http://cusplibrary.github.io/.
Click on "Get Cusp", the rightmost menu item, to download the library.  Extract
the downloaded archive, then copy the contents in the extracted directory to a
directory called cusplibrary located at the top of where you have put this
project's source.

Initial Setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first step is to configure the initial build system using autotools.  To do
this, run:

$ ./autogen.sh

Backend Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The default backend is cusp_gpu.  If you wish explicitly specify to build
using the cusp_gpu backend, supply the argument --with-backend=cusp_gpu
to the configure script (see below for more detail).

Configuring for the Sequential Backend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the sequential backend (the sequential backend is for simple CPU
implementation):

$ ./configure --with-backend=sequential

Configuring for the cusp_gpu Backend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To build the cusp gpu backend:

$ ./configure [--with-backend=cusp_gpu]

Final Compilation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compiling the demo programs and unit tests is very simple.  All that must be
done is:

$ make

Installation
------------

The current library is set up as a header only library.  To install this
library, copy the graphblas directory to a location in your include path
(probably /usr/include or /usr/local/include).  If you wish to use the cusp
backend, make sure to place the cusp library in your include path as well.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation can be generated using the Doxygen documentation system.  To
generate documentation, Configure
